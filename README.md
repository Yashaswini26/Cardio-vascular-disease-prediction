**Prediction of Cardiovascular Disease**
**Project Overview**
This project aims to predict cardiovascular disease using machine learning algorithms and data mining techniques. It incorporates a Flask API to provide an interactive front-end where users can check their health status based on various attributes.

**Project Supervisor:** Dr. Abdelmounaam Rezgui (Associate Professor, School of Information Technology)

**Technology Stack**

**Programming Language:** Python

**Frameworks & Libraries:** Flask, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy

**Development Tools:** Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook

**Machine Learning Algorithms Used:**
Random Forest (Best Accuracy: 74%)
Decision Tree
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Logistic Regression
Linear Regression

**Dataset**
The model is trained on a dataset containing 70,000 records with attributes like age, weight, gender, cholesterol, glucose level, and smoking habits.
Data preprocessing and feature selection techniques were applied to improve model performance.

**Results & Benefits**
The model predicts the likelihood of cardiovascular disease with an accuracy of 74% (using the Random Forest algorithm).
Helps individuals assess their heart health based on key risk factors.
Provides ease of use, accessibility, and accurate predictions.
